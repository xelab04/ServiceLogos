Uh, yeah, Kubernetes but cute.

V1 is as I posted on the Discord channel.
V2 removes the pink parts which are inside the logo, which felt a bit weird to me. It also removes the tiny pink parts on the top, which may be a pain for stickers, I dunno.
V3 removes the little visible bit of box inside the U, and features the same changes as V2.

If you want them mixed and matched or want some other change, feel free to raise an issue. This logo is made by me, Alex, replicating Sarawatsuki's style.
